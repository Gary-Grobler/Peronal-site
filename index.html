        <h3>Just a few of my skills</h3>
        <p>I am first and foremost a writer. I currently work as a Laboritory Assistant for a pathology lab. I am also an avid gamer with what could be considered as far too many hours in Dota 2. I am also a Web Developer and would love to be
          employed as such.</p>

        <h3>My goals</h3>
        <p>I have many goals. One of them was to be a published writer, and I have thankfully achieved that <a href="https://www.malherbe-uitgewers.co.za/gary-j-grobler"> (check this out)</a>. Now another is to work in the IT industry as a developer.
          As such I am currently working hard to develope my web design and coding skills. This website is an example of some of the things I have managed to learn while on this journey
          to become a compitent coder. </p>
